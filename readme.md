# Anagrams

This website allows users to input two strings and check to see if they are anagrams. 

## Assumptions
1. A string is at least one character. 
2. A string can contain Roman characters, non-Roman characters, punctuation, etc... 
3. Spaces don't count as characters. 

## Code
I wrote the code with readability in mind. While there are certainly 
tradeoffs with regards to runtime and complexity, the methods we call 
in JavaScript to check for anagrams are so easy to understand that even the
common layperson would understand.
